This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL, with the key goals of data cleaning, transformation, and discovering possible business insights.
The dataset includes customer transactions, returned orders, and customer segmentation data. Which allowed me to generate queries to answer useful questions.

I performed:
- Data Cleaning – Fixed column names, reformatted dates, and handled missing data
- Data Transformation – Converted text fields, aggregated data, and categorized customers
- SQL Queries – Used JOINS, CTEs, CASE statements, Window Functions, and Aggregations
- Business Insights – Identified sales trends, return rates, and customer behavior





This project utilizes three main tables:

-Orders Table (orders)
Contains details on all transactions.
Key Columns:
Order_ID – Unique identifier for each order
Order_Date – The date of the purchase
Customer_ID, Customer_Name – Customer details
Product_ID, Product_Name, Category – Product information
Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount – Transaction details

-Returned Orders Table (returned)
Tracks returned orders.
Key Columns:
Order_ID – Matches with orders to identify returned purchases
Returned – Flag to indicate if the order was returned

-Customer Segmentation Table (people)
Stores customer-related data.
Key Columns:
Person – Matches Customer_Name in orders
